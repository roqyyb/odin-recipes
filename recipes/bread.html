    <h2>Banana Bread</h2>
    <p>
      This banana bread is spiked with dark chocolate chips and walnuts. Banana
      bread is one of those things people rarely make on purpose â€” only when
      those last 3 bananas are almost black. However, this scrumptious loaf is
      so good you'll want to make it well before the bananas reach that
      condition.

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat a 9x4-inch loaf
        pan with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium
        bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat together sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl
        until smooth. Add mashed bananas and mix until combined. Add eggs, one
        at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in milk and vanilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in flour mixture, walnuts, and chocolate chips until just
        incorporated. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Tap pan on the
        counter to release any air pockets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Let rest in the pan for 15
        to 20 minutes. Remove bread from the pan, then slice and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
