    <h2>Buttermilk pancake</h2>
    <p>
      A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but
      it's the best I've ever made!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Leaveners</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>Buttermilk</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large
        bowl. Beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter in a
        separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to
        cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You
        can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's
        ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to
        mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy
        which is what you want.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately
        1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to
        2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side.
        Repeat with remaining batter.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
